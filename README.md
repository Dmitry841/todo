# Getting Started

Good afternoon. This is a small task book. To start the client part locally, you need to create a .env file in the root of the client folder, and fill in the following fields in this file according to your settings:
PORT=
DB_NAME=
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_HOST=
DB_PORT=
SECRET_KEY=

Then you need to create DB server and call the "npm run dev" command in command line
